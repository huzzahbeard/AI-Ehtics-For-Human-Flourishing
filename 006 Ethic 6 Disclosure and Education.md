By trade I am a developer. Not a fancy one. I remember slicing PSDs and placing each JPG precisely into the proper table cell[^1]. I have come very far both technically, professionally, and in leadership amongst those I am responsible for. AI presents a massive temptation and opportunity[^2]. 

AI can educate[^3]. I have no innate talents. Some people are born being kind of good at something. They have a mind and body for sports. They naturally write well or can do complex math in their heads. The only innate talent I personally lay claim to is the ability to assimilate information and contextualize it into useful skills[^4] and insights quicker than most. I am forty two at the time of writing and this skill feels sharper than ever. I have hung my hat and livelihood on this skill. AI has been a boon for me. The speed at which I can get accurate information to add to my own thinking is wonderful and addictive in a lot of ways. It's like going down the encyclopedia rabbit hole but so much better. 

AI tools are getting better and in the act of getting information via AI there is a temptation. AI in a lot of ways and in an increasing range of industries could do the work for us. 

## Why AI Usage and How It Was Used Should Be Disclosed In All Areas it is Used. 

When I look at a php class or function that a developer vibe[^5] coded I should see a comment on that code that says which model they used and maybe some explanation as to what was prompted into the AI. If I read a news article it should say the author was Chat GPT. Better yet when you read this document you will see the Author was Aaron Blakeley and it was proofed for spelling and grammar mistakes by Claude Sonnet 4.5. If a missile strike kills 12 civilians we want to know if it was a human that made that decision or was it some AI that just was delegated the authority to kill. 

This is important because the human remains responsible. Transparency means that human responsibility and human credit can be given where it is due. Without full AI disclosures in movies, music, code, governmental decisions, etc., the responsibility that is placed on humans, the same that truth and justice rely on, will move further and further from our reach as an all powerful scape goat[^6] assimilates all we delegate to it.

## Ethic 6 Synopsis

All AI usage, how it was used, where it was used, and what prompts were given to get the outputs should be disclosed and attached to the human consumable outputs. AI should be used largely for educating oneself. AI is tool. AI is encyclopedia. Human dignity requires human judgement.

[^1]: They called it pixel perfection. It was a blight.
[^2]: Temptation for over use. Opportunity at the levels of the printing press. 
[^3]: There should be discretion here. Educate in that it can curate content in a way that is very useful, discretion because it can be wrong or misleading. 
[^4]: While not reaching excellence in any of them. 
[^5]: To vibe code is to just prompt the AI and let it do the work for you.
[^6]: Imagine a juggernaut. You can cast all your mistakes and foibles onto it yet it barrels through your life destroying everything in its path.

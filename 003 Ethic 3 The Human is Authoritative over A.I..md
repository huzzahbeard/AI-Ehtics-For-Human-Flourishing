Does the potter have supreme authority over the pot?

## Why is the Human Supremely Authoritative

For us the things we create might outlast us by many generations[^1]. The plane has far surpassed the longevity of the Wright brothers. The Odyssey has far exceeded the life span of Homer[^2]. There is no greater authority on the Odyssey than Homer. At the time of its creation there was no greater authority on the plane than the Wright brothers.

The Wright brothers had authority of the moment. An initial creation. They had control of the form. They decided on and explored its bounds. Giving birth to aviation. From this point on they did not have authority over it. It took on a life of its own. Innovation and iteration have expanded the horizons of flight all the way to space travel. The "life of its own" was in so far as the humans[^3] that participated in aviation took it. If for some reason the idea of flying never had gained popularity, there would be no aviation today. 

Homer had full creative control of the Odyssey[^4]. He chose the scope, its characters, how long the book was, he even put meaning into it. Homer had a goal in writing the book. A goal, a meaning that we cannot know. We have two writings from Homer. We have nothing else. This has left room for 3000[^5] years of speculation about the themes, motivations, and purpose of these stories. Speculation by humans who in their own right become authorities on the Odyssey.

AI has access to all of this. It can probably describe the Odyssey better or as good as the leading researcher. It can perfectly recite and even teach aviation concepts that the Wright brothers will never hear or understand. Yet the same thread remains. The only reason that AI knows anything is because the human knows something[^6]. A human somewhere knew something and wrote it down. Then it ended up in the training data. The pot is not greater than the potter. The potter has supreme authority over the pot.

## Warnings on Authority

Ethics rarely come to being before the thing that they are being applied[^7] to. This holds more true about AI than most inventions. We have already ceded a portion of our own authority to AI and algorithms[^8]. Just think about your social media feed. Sure you "subscribe" to people but do you really control what you are fed? This holds true for so many things in the modern era. 

Even though the cat is out of the bag, the ethic still needs to be stated. Perhaps it will allow for better people to guide the technology. Though we have delegated authority to AI in a lot of ways we still remain responsible. We can only hope.

## Ethic 3 Synopsis

Humans are authoritative over AI because the creation is not greater than the creator. The creator has fundamental authority over the created and though in some ways a creation may do something specifically better than the creator, like a pot holding a scalding hot liquid, this is not evidence of superiority but rather evidence of design. AI is tool not replacement. 

[^1]: One can only hope.
[^2]: It amazes me when I think of the age of some of the literature we read. 
[^3]: This is key. It is in the human that these ideas carry weight. The bird does not consider aviation. The book does not consider literature. AI as clever a tool as it is does not consider. 
[^4]: This does raise the question of divine texts like the Bible. When you consider the existence of God and his inspiration we can start to see where something like the Bible might actually be greater than the writer. Though in those cases we start to call these things titles like "The word of God" acknowledging its otherworldliness. 
[^5]: Amazing.
[^6]: This is a unique danger of AI. I discuss something about it later but it might as well show up here as well. The AI seems to know something but 'know' is a sneaky term. It is the term that applies here but when we say know I think we intuitively think understanding. The AI knows in that it can recall information but it does not understand it. It can not. It can't even know if it understands or not and in that sense can not bridge the gap between the recall and the understanding. 
[^7]: Maybe never.
[^8]: This cat is out of the bag and nothing short of a nuclear holocaust will stop it. Honestly maybe not even that.

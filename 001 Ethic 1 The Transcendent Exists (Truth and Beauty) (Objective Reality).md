AI in its current iteration can do some impressive things. It can pattern match across wide swathes of data and even return novel combinations of information[^1]. Combinations that may have not been explicitly tread by humans. This is for lack of a better term "spooky". It gives pause to the thinker and the old adage I think therefore I am comes to mind[^2]. 

AI proves[^3] something about thought and language. It proves that thought and thinking at least some useful portion of it is statistically mathematical in a mechanical sense and the medium is language. 

This brings, in my mind,[^4] into the spotlight something that can never be quantified but remains true. There is a transcendent quality to reality. There is good and evil. There is truth and lies. There is justice and corruption. There is beauty and repulsion. 

## Why does the transcendent exist?

To understand transcendent[^5] reality we must establish objectivity[^6]. You and I can go out to a forest and stand beneath a tree. We can touch its bark. We can climb it. The tree objectively exists. Then comes along the poet or maybe it's just you under its canopy lounging in the shade. The branches remind you of your mother. The poet writes something profound about family while looking at the tree. You have tears in the corners of your eyes because looking through the leaves you understand some struggle your father tried to explain to you when you were young. The poet captures in the description of a tree what it feels like to understand a lover. [^7]

The understanding sets boundaries, opens gates, and changes you. You will never be the same. Even if you decide to ignore the understanding to cast aside this awe that has befallen you. You will always be a person who chose that[^8]. Never a person who did not experience that transcendent movement of your spirit. 

This is central and fundamental. I will say with one hundred percent certainty. This is something that can never be reproduced in AI because ultimately it is not something we do[^9]  but what makes us who we are.

We think yes. This is an act that has proven to be somewhat mechanical and reproducible. However, eternity and something beyond ourselves was put in us. It is beyond us yet also somehow within our grasp. 

## Ethic 1 Synopsis

Objective reality exists. The transcendent exists. AI will never be able to tap into the transcendent. It is tool not oracle. We must never reduce the human to an algorithmic reproduction. [^10]

[^1]: This often results in very RNG style outputs but it is nonetheless impressive. 
[^2]: Rene Descartes
[^3]: By proves. I do not mean beyond a reasonable doubt. What I mean is as it functions now this seems to be the case. 
[^4]: Hopefully in yours.
[^5]: Man has a longing for God. Man will worship something. 
[^6]: A task for which I am "unqualified" but will nonetheless boldly tread.
[^7]: This kind of experience is lacking in society today. These kinds of things can only happen when there is a lack of distraction. Most people would lounge under a tree and maybe have a podcast or music playing. For most of human existence people have lived in mostly silence. With music being either a rarity or at least a treat. It did not play in our ears twenty-four seven. I have fallen victim to this and have even started to make serious corrections. We must allow quiet and our thoughts to be the norm. This does not mean that music and podcasts are evil. It just means they should once again be put in balance. 
[^8]: This is a hard lesson that marks maturity; Realizing that to know something and then ignore it is in itself a choice. Comfort with this state even an embracing of it makes one mature. Not necessarily wise, but mature.
[^9]: A quantifiable mechanical action.
[^10]: Unfortunately this is exactly what the most nefarious actors do. The sad truth is that it can be very effective. Facebook can predict when you poop with some accuracy. However, Facebook can not reproduce or understand that transcendent nature.

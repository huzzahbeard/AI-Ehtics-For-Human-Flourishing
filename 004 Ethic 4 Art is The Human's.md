Art is the human expression of the transcendent[^1]. Drawings of John Arbuckle slaying Garfield have brought people to tears. Paint strokes of an eccentric man named Da Vinci have survived for 500 years. Religious books that encapsulate the will of God over many authors and hundreds of years sit on my book shelf. A man named Andy Warhol painted a soup can and said something profound about the mundane. A painting of a historical event transports us there. A song on the radio causes us not only to remember but to feel that first kiss. 

## Why is Art the Human's

Art suffers and humans suffer art[^2]. We are drawn to it[^3]-the narrative[^4]. The visual story. That right note with the perfect word. The movie that changes us because we finally understand[^5]. It takes effort to make art. The effort[^6] is what makes art, art and not a lie or some kind of mimicry of art. We suffer art because humans have a tendency to feel before we think, and objective reality can be quantified. This means that a reasonable facsimile of the transcendent with little effort can be very lucrative but also destructive. 

Art suffers because there is an economic and attention gathering incentive to produce low effort facsimiles of art. Sure it can elicit a feeling the same way meth can elicit pleasure. You probably want to avoid the meth. The facsimiles are in the end substance less. They are empty. Just thoughtless effortless wastes.

AI makes it very easy to produce visuals and narratives that move past our defenses in a way that few other things can. This is the chief reason why art should remain solely in the domain of the human. 

## A Warning about Art

This is another one of the ethics that has already been violated. In fact it was probably the first thing to be violated[^7]. I can not advocate for the abolition of AI tools in the creation of art. I myself have used AI even in the creation of these ethics for spell checking and research. This is why the Ethic is so important. If you create art, you must create it ethically—do not let AI decide the direction of your work. It is tool not oracle. It is tool not artist.

### Where Is The Line

I am unsure I can with clear accuracy identify the line that gets crossed when one is using AI to create art. I think about the printing press or the type writer. There used to be scribes whose whole existence was creating beautiful text in tomes. Then the printing press and movable type hit the scene and suddenly maybe scribes aren't as needed anymore. Was the printing press a bridge too far?

The type writer and word-processor occupy a similar space. My own handwriting suffers this technology. I can output readable text at a rate near thought. If I wrote you something on a piece of paper then you might be hard-pressed to know what I wrote. Did this cross the line? 

I think about hand writing. If I had a machine that I could purchase that could produce beautiful calligraphy and I took that machine and purchased the calligraphy templates and used them. Then I took these pages of beautiful calligraphy and sold them to others and they willingly purchased them as art, are they art?

I think if we go to the definition of art as it stands today in 2025 Anno Domini we find what I think really answers the question. 

**Art**
The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. 

Now I would include in this written works as well. 

**So where is the line? When the tool is used in lieu of the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.** 

## Ethic 4 Synopsis

Art is the sole domain of humans because art moves past our defenses like nothing else can. It seeks to encapsulate the transcendent in more than just words, narrative, visuals, music, and experience. These are the realms that AI can not participate in. They cannot be quantified. Anything AI produces along these lines are simply facsimiles that will subtly do more harm than good. AI is tool not artist.

[^1]: Ethic one is closely related to this but two and three had to come first. They lay the foundation for something like art being preserved. There is space for AI to enable more and more people to express profound things. More and more capacity for the sharing of those things. But the waters froth with danger and we are weak of flesh. 
[^2]: It is a sweet suffering and worth every moment.
[^3]: Not all *art* is art.
[^4]: This stuff of thought and culture.
[^5]: AI can not understand.
[^6]: There is a line here. Effort, but where is the effort applied? Sure to paint someone once had to go and find their own pigments and discover a medium. Then they could mix them together and paint. I don't have to do that. I can buy paint at a store. I used to have to be able to spell every word perfectly. Today I can use a spell checker. No one blinks at a spell checker. There is a specific place in the creative process where effort must be applied to make something art. Is the artist that paints with oils greater than the artist that paints with pixels? No they both paint. Their skill is what differentiates them. It is the act of doing the art. The creative. It is a transcendent space where the human operates. Tools and technology can actually ease burden around that space allowing for more time spent in the transcendent space that makes art, art. But that space must be preserved.
[^7]: As soon as AI could generate images the AI artist was born. It is a very sad thing that those individuals will not know the pleasure of the creative process.

When you sit on a porch and drink a nice glass of your favorite beverage and watch the sun set with a loved one, not a word passing between the two yet somehow connected, this is where art has actually done a fantastic job of capturing and expounding on the problem we are presented with. In the movie *her* Theodore builds a relationship with an artificial intelligence named Samantha. It works for a time but it eventually falls apart. Samantha is an AI after all and is "in love" with 641 people while talking to thousands. This is devastating to Theodore. However, in fiction all things are possible. Samantha essentially ascends to a higher plane withdrawing from humanity with the other AIs. This allows Theodore to create an actual human connection with another woman in the movie.

## Why Humans for Humans

All of civilization hangs on the family unit[^2]. It hangs on the relationship between a man and a woman and their coupling[^3] not just sexually[^4] but relationally. Christians and other religions see this institution as being handed down by God[^5]. No matter what you believe this means that these relationships come from somewhere else other than the mechanical and material. AI can not access the transcendent and relationships fall squarely in this realm. AI can also create reasonable and even convincing facsimiles of art and narrative. These are not actually art and narrative but they move just as effectively past our defenses. 

Narrative can be used to generate a feeling of connection. A relational connection with AI is not an actual connection. Though it can feel as such. It moves past our defenses even more effectively. Relationships require risk of pain and rejection for the reward of some of the greatest pleasures and fulfillment reality has to offer. AI can promise that and even trick us into pursuing or experimenting with it on a relational level. The risk is minimal. It won't reject you. You can just turn it off. It's like breathing carbon monoxide. It works like air. Then you die. Futurama also made a great point and it should be noted. Don't date robots[^6]. 

## Ethic 5 Synopsis

All of human flourishing and civilization rests on the family unit. This relationship and all others are transcendent. AI can not access the transcendent but it can create a narrative that moves past our defenses. AI is tool. AI is not lover or friend.

[^1]: We will not be so lucky
[^2]: This is in my opinion undisputable. It also underlines the current ills of society as villainous ideas straight from the pit have sought to strip life of all its meaning right down to the family unit.
[^3]: There is no earthly coupling greater; all other pairings are lesser compared to the coupling of man and woman.
[^4]: Specifically at the production of offspring. I will acknowledge that not all male and female couplings produce offspring but I am of the mind that it should be a goal at the very least. 
[^5]: Not an institution that humans dreamt up. 
[^6]: Truly a profound piece of content.

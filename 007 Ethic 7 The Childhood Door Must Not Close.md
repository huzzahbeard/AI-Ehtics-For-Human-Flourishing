I am unsure if this is an ethic or a prescription[^1] but I will frame it as ethic for the sake of structure. When we are born we can not walk. We observe, are observed, we have instinct, and are encouraged[^2]. Then one day we take a first step. We feel the grass beneath our feet and the weight of our frame. We are not distracted we are focused on the parent with their arms out calling us to them. Then we walk. A moment in space where our balance moves from theory to reality. [^3]

In the modern era this moment is immediately followed by our first iPad and an endless stream of video garbage. Our formative years wiped by a stream of little more than colorful static[^4]. 

## Why The Doors Must Not Close

Our children have their innocence strip mined for revenue and experimentation[^5] at a scale that would probably curdle the blood of Pablo Escobar[^6]. Our children do not face a single solitary chance in the face of AI and the internet. Even us adults are vulnerable how much more are the young. 

We must not close the door to childhood. Instead we should leave it open for the young to walk through and enjoy and grow. They should be free of the influence of these technologies. In all bluntness I am advocating for us to raise children like luddites[^7] and treat the technologies like alcohol you can partake when you are mature, you have been educated, and you can make a decision that is critical and calculated. If we do not do this, we really will live in the world of *Idiocracy* or *Brave New World*. Perhaps both.

## Children Values, Morals, and How to Think

It is true and in my estimation common sense but it is clear that it must be stated. Parents your children do not know how to think, what to think, or how to even begin to evaluate the nuances of reality and society[^8]. It is your job as parents to instill in them these things: morals, values, and critical thinking. If you do not then someone will. It will happen. It is as inevitable as the sun rising. If you do not teach your children then someone will. In the dawning of this technological dystopia it will be the strangers, and AI online unless you do your part and shield them. 

## Ethic 7 Synopsis

AI moves past human defenses in the adult and much more so in the young[^9]. The young deserve the opportunity to grow and mature without the influence of these technologies. This will allow them to have a great degree of self actualization. We should not close the door to childhood. AI is tool not parent. 

[^1]: What I am sure of is that amongst all the things written in this essay. If we get this one right perhaps the rest will right itself.
[^2]: Encouragement is an overwhelmingly positive activity but we should always be testing the objects of that encouragement.
[^3]: There are many such moments in life like this. When, purity, beauty, and truth meet in a reality testing apex, culminating in discovering the beauty of such things like water is wet and fire is hot.
[^4]: Static meaning useless noise.
[^5]: Social media, transgenderism, DEI in schools, struggle sessions, homosexual content and general sexual content in children's content...
[^6]: Pablo Escobar was a drug lord responsible for countless murders yet held his children and others as great in value.
[^7]: At our own expense. God knows I have not succeeded but I did try.
[^8]: There are all manner of teachings in the modern era that prescribe 'gentle parenting', letting the child tell you who they are, or suggesting that the child actually knows better some how. In all bluntness, your children are savages and it is your job to civilize then. If you look in the mirror and realize that you too are still a savage then it is time to become civilized. The hour is late. 
[^9]: Things moving past defenses is not necessarily the main thrust of the issue. However, it is the red flag for caution. Beauty and truth can move just as easily past our defenses. It is the content, the objective, and the motives-largely unknowable-that should raise our defenses and inspire us to shield our children.

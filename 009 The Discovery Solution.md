There is an answer to the Ouroboros problem. Unfortunately it is a very idealistic solution. Those are arguably the best kind of solutions but also the ones least likely to occur. When humans create systems that attempt to force other humans into compliance tyranny tends to spring up. When humans produce culture and other humans adopt that culture and choose[^1] to change their behavior societies, families, and your fellow humans flourish or at least flourish in culture that promotes truth and beauty. 

To solve the issue of the Ouroboros it will require a view of the future starting with children and even young adults. I have emphasized the spiritual throughout. This was done because discovery being something of a transcendent act and the communication of those discoveries is key to correcting the trajectory of humans out of a spiral into post human and death cult views. 

What are we to discover? Anything. Explore. Leave your phone. Leave the technology. Leave the drugs and the constant distractions. Grab hold of physical tactile objects, books, pens, paper, go and observe, meditate, hike. Then tell us of your experiences. Parents teach your kids this. Teach them how to think. Show them and even discover for yourself what is actually valuable. Detach from the electronically connected world and instead connect with the people around you. Even if you hate or despise them. Connect with humans, learn, discover.

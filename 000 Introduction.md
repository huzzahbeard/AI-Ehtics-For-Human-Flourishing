## Who Is This For

For people.

## Who am I

I am an anonymous Christian who has worked in web and web application development for over a decade. WordPress, Laravel, PHP, HTML, MYSQL, CSS, JavaScript, problem solving, data organizing and reporting, API integrations, these have been my bread and butter. There is no good reason to listen to me. I am a father of five and I care for my children. This care and an overwhelming drive from God to write this, is the driving force behind this essay[^1].

## The What

This is an essay or pamphlet written to try and organize what I feel are axioms that will be assailed by AI. It is to explore how we[^2] might push back in our individual ways and create a future that is human flourishing centric. A future that might encourage and make wealthy[^3] the coming generations.

## Footnotes

I love footnotes. I am using them. Feel free to read them.[^4]
## The When

Now. It is never too late[^5]. Not until you pay your tax to the worms.

## The Where

Look around you. Look at the faces of the people around you. Do you not see any? Are you lonely? You need to be around people. You need human connection.[^6] So I will make a strong statement. A risky request. 

I don't care what you think about God or Christianity. Go to church. A lot of people don't want to go because they feel judged or don't want to be told some idea they hold is wrong[^7]. That's okay. You can even think it's all hooey. Be honest about this but still go. Make friends. Be loved and challenge their beliefs. Listen to the sermons and sing the songs. Sure you don't believe as long as you are clear about that what's the harm? Eat the casserole at the pot luck. You will be allowed to[^8]. You will be accepted in your honesty. If you are not? Try the next church. Why? Because you need people.

## The How

For me it is the Holy Spirit; it is devotion to God[^9]. For those that don't believe or subscribe to that, it is the individual; it is purpose. It is aiming for something more than the masturbatory simulation of the human spirit[^10]. It is a choice to be more than just part of the quickly distilling ouroboros of AI technology. You are an individual with the capability of novel transcendent purpose, experience, and thought. What hubris to think that something like us—created, tooled—would be able to create something greater than itself. What is greater? The potter or the pot? What is greater, the car or the car building machine? So how do we push back? We remain individuals and revel in the individuality of those around[^11] us. As a Christian you couple this with worship and devotion to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and his teachings. Then you create with ethics. 

## The Why

I was told recently by a peer that the company he works for only hires senior level developers and instructs them to use AI to write most of their code. This birthed in me a profound sadness. In that company, for a young person wanting to weave the magical words of coding and development, the door is closed and the lock is turned. The old guard is keeping the spoils. I refuse to keep the spoils. I refuse to let the creative spark of human ingenuity die in a storm of meaningless orgasms while watching AI generated porn[^12]. All because we did not leave the way open. 

## Clarity

I thought for a while I was against AI usage altogether. I am not anymore. What I am is against its usage where the human spirit should reign supreme.[^13] I don't think there is a hard fast rule on whether or not AI should be used in something. Art is a bridge too far in my opinion. Using it to code 90% of your code base is a bridge too far, it feels. I think because this is an emergent technology there needs to be ethics around it. Something by which we can all agree and judge our own motivations and goals. [^14]

## Religion Disclosure

I will reference the Bible a lot. It is maybe the most influential book in human history. Though I believe that all things find their origin in God, I will refrain moving forward from pleading the case for Christ. Instead I will focus on preserving his creation.

[^1]: I went back and forth on what to call this. Originally in my mind it felt like a pamphlet. It is disappointingly short for the subject matter. This is due to my desire for it to be short and for it to be simple to understand. 
[^2]: We desperate few.
[^3]: wealth of family, wealth of human connection, wealth of purpose, wealth of spiritual life, wealth of resources.
[^4]: Who doesn't love a good footnote?
[^5]: While you still draw breath.
[^6]: I had a conversation with one of my daughters who could not stop talking to a chat bot. During that conversation I told her my concern was that she was missing something and that only she could tell me what that was. She just wanted to convince me that I was making a big deal of something that was not a big deal. I told her I was going to take it from her and that she would not be able to use it ever again. After the small wave of panic on her face subsided I asked her what she was missing. She said she was missing the human interaction and that though she knew it was not real she was using it fulfill that need. She got the point yes. The vulnerability to humans to this technology is great. It moves right past our defenses. 
[^7]: Everyone holds wrong ideas. All should allow their beliefs to be challenged. Hold fast to what is true. Which is a different statement than hold fast to what can be proven through evidence. Though evidence can increase the certainty of truth as long as it is evaluated truthfully. 
[^8]: It should be noted that the Bible instructs us to have orderly worship. Most churches will remove you if you come in and disrupt service. The attention is on God not you.
[^9]: I know there are other religions. I get it. I would be less than loving if I did not point you to the one that I felt was correct. If a Muslim did not try to convince me of his Muslim faith I would assume he hated me. 
[^10]: I think this phrase "masturbatory stimulation of the human spirit" sums up everything that is wrong online and in our current cultural discourse. From politics, entertainment, down to technology, and even in the worse kind of way public religious practice. All of these can succumb and some more than others often do fall and can be described as such. 
[^11]: It should be noted that reveling in the individuality around us does not mean universally condoning everyone's actions or beliefs. Right and wrong, good and evil still exist. 
[^12]: I don't feel bad for the imagery the hour is late; you should be shocked.
[^13]: We give up something of ourselves when we invent. It is part of the process. We think things like, "I can hunt a deer by running at it." That is really hard though and I need more food to feed my tribe. So we invent the bow and arrow. Now more people can hunt and we don't have to be so fast. We give up our speed. Then we think these horses are hard to handle and I have to feed them. Eventually we invent the car and we give up our animal symbiosis relegating it to recreation. Each time we invent we give up something of ourselves. Even the keyboard I use. It enables me to write at a speed that matches my thoughts. However, my handwriting is terrible. With AI one of the many threats is us giving up our ability to think. 
[^14]: I imagine the struggle for an intellectual in an essay like this is that I will really not be referencing any of the major philosophers. I have read *Republic*, *Abolition of Man*, *The Gay Science*, *The Five Proofs* but mostly I have read science fiction and fantasy. I have not studied these things. I have just swam in the industry. Common sense and a sense of right and wrong are the worldly guiding principles here. Beyond that it is my faith and a desire to see the next generation more healthy and happy than the last.

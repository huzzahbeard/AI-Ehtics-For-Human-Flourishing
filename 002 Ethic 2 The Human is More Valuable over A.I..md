Ethic 2 follows on the heels of Ethic 1.

Matthew 26:8-13

When the disciples saw this[^1], they were indignant. **“Why this waste?**” they asked. 9 “This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.”

Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? **She has done a beautiful thing to me.** **The poor you will always have with you[^2],** but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, **what she has done will also be told, in memory of her**.”

## Why The Human is Supremely Valuable

The human's value is plainly evident. The dog sees the dog as supremely valuable. The cow sees the cow as supremely valuable. The human sees the human as supremely valuable. Without the human we do not even have this problem to discuss. [^3]

There are cynics out there that would argue that things might be a lot better without us. How would you even know? Would you be the first to pioneer this approach? Of course not. We should take such points and set them alongside the same dusty arguments that the eugenicists, racists, communists, and Marxists make. [^4]

The human is valuable because we are them[^5]. Without us there is no us. The human produces the most human flourishing possible. From the human flows actions that benefit humans greatly[^6]. The human is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but the human is supremely valuable. 

As it pertains to AI, its usage and its implementation, humans are at the helm. AI does not exist without the human. If you believe in evolution, if something else had crawled out of the ooze and become something completely different, there would for sure be a different outcome. Maybe it would be AI like but those beings would be at the helm and in their own alternate history the ethic would state that they are supremely valuable. 

## Ethic 2 Synopsis

The human is supremely valuable. Without the human there is no human flourishing.  Without the human there is no AI. The AI is not the point. The human and its flourishing are the point. AI must never be used to determine the worth of a human. AI is tool not judge.

[^1]: What had transpired before was a woman, Mary, had broken protocol and entered a dinner party. She had heaped indignity upon herself and broke an alabaster jar. Alabaster being something delicate and beautiful. The jar was filled with expensive perfume. She then anointed Jesus with the perfume. This was an act of unrepentant worship. It was raw and true in every sense of the word. 
[^2]: No matter how we structure society there will always be the poor. How the people treat the poor of society is a reflection on us. To be specific I do not mean the government. I mean you and me. Of our own resources that we control how do we use them? It is radical but the care for the poor is not the domain of governments it is the domain of the individual. It is a responsibility of the church.
[^3]: I will be the first to admit that a philosopher could probably do a better job at explaining this. I think that the argument before you in that a human can and should see humans as valuable falls into the realm of common sense. 
[^4]: There is a vein of thinking that seeks to devalue the individual in preference to the whole. They set themselves up as governments mostly as religion tends to be caustic to this kind of thinking.
[^5]: There are other reasons. The human is valuable because he/she is created in the image of God. The human is valuable because of all the animals on the planets we are the only ones that produce technology. I do like simple ideas though. They have an elegance. 
[^6]: ... and harm. Though harm and benefit flow from many other sources. All things good flow from God but true to my word from the beginning I am striving to dial back the religious in the main body of the essay.
